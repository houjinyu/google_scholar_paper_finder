Machine learning and its fields of study have been contributing a lot for the development of intelligent systems and devices, ranging from voice recognition systems to self driving cars. In recent years, one of the areas that has most achieved benefits from the development of machine learning was the computer vision area, with the use of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). The concept of artificial CNNs was first proposed in the 90s, by Yann LeCun, but this new concept only became famous in 2012, when a CNN won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challange - ILSVRC. It started the development of new techniques for classifying images, such as deep learning. In the architecture of CNNs, the first layers are responsible for detecting generic features, as horizontal and vertical lines, curves, edges, etc. The following layers detect more specific and sometimes more abstract features, which do not always have a human meaning. Such configuration of CNNs was based on the visual cortex of cats. In a research made by David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Weisel, published in 1962, it was discovered that there are cells in the cats' visual cortex that specialize themselves on detecting specific features, like lines, while other cells specialize on detecting curves. This was the idea which helped Yann LeCun to create the artificial CNNs, where different neurons can detect different features maximizing its recognition power. This research will take advantage of such power to develop a retrained CNN to classify human facial emotions in images.
